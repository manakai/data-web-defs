Data types used in data files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

/T/? where /T/ is a type

  A value of type /T/ or null.

  The "null" value is represented by the JSON null value or missing of
  the value.

boolean

  The "false" value is represented by either JSON false value, JSON
  number value zero, JSON string value "0", or missing of the value.

  The "true" value is represented by a value that is not false.

id-in-spec

  A |string| which represents the ID in a specification.

    If the specification is generated by Anolis, the value can be
    converted to the fragment identifier for the HTML version of the
    specification by replacing any U+0020 character by a |-| character
    and converting to ASCII lowercase.

    Otherwise, if the specification is generated by rfcmarkup, the
    value is the fragment identifier in the HTML version of the
    document at the |tools.ietf.org| Web site.

    Otherwise, if the specification is "DATAVOCAB", the value is the
    global identifier used in the microdata definition.

    Otherwise, the value is the fragment identifier in the HTML
    version of the specification.

  See the |specs.json| data file for the list of specifications and
  their generators.

members

  A JSON object whose names are names associated with the members and
  values are descriptions of the members.  Their semantics depends on
  the context in use.  See also "Web IDL object" section.

number

  A number value is represented by a JSON number value, a JSON string
  value which contains a JSON number value, or a JSON string value
  "Infinity", "-Infinity", or "NaN".

object

  A JSON object.

spec

  A |string| which is one of specification keys (names in the |specs|
  object) contained in the specs.json data file.

status

  A |string| which is one of specification status keys (names in the
  |statuses| object) contained in the specs.json data file.

string

  A JSON string value, which is interpreted as is, or a JSON number
  value, which is represented as a string that is equal to the
  canonical representation of the number value.

* The "preferred" object

The "preferred" object is used to represent the alternative form in
|data/elements.json| and |data/aria.json|.

Usually, the target of the "preferred" object is obsolete, deprecated,
or otherwise discouraged such that should not be used and the
"preferred" form should be used instead.  How it is discouraged might
be described by other properties for the target.  The existence of the
"preferred" object does not itself imply any status of the target.

The "preferred" object is a JSON object with one or more name/value
pairs.  It always contains |type| name/value pair.  Depending on the
|type| value, there might be additional name/value pairs, as described
below.

If |type|'s value is |html_element|, an HTML element whose local name
is |name|'s value should be used instead.

If |type|'s value is |atom_element|, an Atom element whose local name
is |name|'s value should be used instead.

If |type|'s value is |html_attr| and if the element is an HTML
element, the attribute whose name is |name|'s value should be used
instead.  If |element| is also specified, then an HTML element whose
local name is equal to |element| should be used for the attribute.
The |name| value can be |data-*|, which indicates that a custom data
attribute should be used.

If |type|'s value is |atom_attr|, an Atom element whose local name is
|element|'s value should be used instead of the element and an
attribute whose local name is |name|'s value should be used instead of
the attribute.

If |type|'s value is |input|, an HTML |input| element whose |type|
attribute value is |name|'s value should be used instead.

If |type|'s value is |textbox|, an HTML |<input type=text>| or
|textarea| element should be used instead.

If |type|'s value is |th|, an HTML |td| element whose |scope|
attribute value is |scope|'s value should be used instead.

If |type|'s value is |title|, an HTML |title| attribute or an SVG
|title| element should be used instead if applicable.

If |type|'s value is |math|, a MathML |math| element should be used
instead.

If |type|'s value is |css|, CSS should be used instead.

If |type|'s value is |css_prop|, CSS property whose name is equal to
|name|'s value should be used instead.  If |value| is also specified,
its value should be used as the property value.

If |type|'s value is |counter|, CSS counter feature should be used
instead.

If |type|'s value is |script|, a script should be used instead.

If |type|'s value is |text|, texts should be used instead.

If |type|'s value is |comment|, an HTML or XML comment should be used
instead.

If |type|'s value is |vevent| or |vcard|, vEvent or vCard external
data or embedded microdata should be used instead, respectively.

If |type|'s value is |progressive|, a progressive image format should
be used instead.

If |type|'s value is |omit|, the target should be omitted and no
alternative is necessary (i.e. the target is redundant).

If |type|'s value is |none|, there is no alternative.

* "element-state" values

States of elements are represented by one of following strings:

  The empty string - Any state
  |hidden-attr|    - If HTML |hidden| attribute is specified
  |usemap-attr|    - If a |usemap| attribute is specified
  |itemprop-attr|  - If an |itemprop| attribute is specified
  |scoped-attr|    - If a |scoped| attribute is specified
  |controls-attr|  - If a |controls| attribute is specified

                     only because it has a |tabindex| attribute
  |inert|          - If the element is inert
  |hyperlink|      - If the element creates a hyperlink
  |hyperlink-noimage| - If the element is a hyperlink and no |img| descendant
  |submit-button|  - For HTML |button| element, |type| is |submit|
  |the-body|       - If the element is the body element of the document
  |no-hgroup|      - If there is no ancestor |hgroup| element
  |empty-alt|      - If the |alt| attribute is the empty string
  |not-empty-alt|  - If there is no |alt| attribute or the |alt| attribute
                     has non-empty value
  |popup|          - If |type| IDL attribute is |popup|
  |toolbar|        - If |type| IDL attribute is |toolbar|
  |multilist|      - If the element represents a multi-select list box
  |singlelist|     - If the element represents a single-select list box
  |dropdown|       - If the element represents a one-line drop down box
  |listbox|        - If the element represents a listbox
  |in-datalist|    - If it represents a suggestion in |datalist|
  |in-select-multilist| - If it is an option in a |select| |multilist|
  |in-select-singlelist| - If it is an option in a |select| |singlelist|
  |in-select-dropdown| - If it is an option in a |select| |dropdown|
  |in-select-listbox| - If it is an option in a |select| |listbox|
  |in-map|         - If there is an ancestor |map| element
  |multiple|       - If |multiple| attribute is specified
  |sort-1|         - If the element is a sorting-capable |th| element whose
                     column key ordinality is 1
  |not-sort-1|     - If not |sort-1|
  |sorting-interface| - If the element is a sorting interface |th| element
  |has-item|       - If there is one or more name-value group (|dl|) or
                     item (|ul| or |ol|)

* Web IDL object

A "Web IDL object" represents a concept in Web IDL.  It is a JSON
string, which represents the type of the object, or a JSON array,
whose first item represents the type of the object and any other items
represent details of the object.

There are following types:

  XXX

If the value is represented by an array of the type and an object with
descriptions, following name/value pairs are used in the object:
