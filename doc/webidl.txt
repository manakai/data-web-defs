This file contains data on Web IDL.

* Structure

The file contains following name/value pairs:

  constructs [object]

    Constructs appear in Web IDL fragments.  Names are short strings
    identifying constructs, and values are their descriptions,
    represented as JSON objects with following name/value pairs:

      allowed_extended_attributes [object?]

        Extended attributes allowed for this construct, if any.  Names
        are extended attribute names and values are boolean true
        values.

      definition [boolean]

        Whether the construct is a definition (i.e. a top-level
        construct) in Web IDL or not.

      dictionary_member [boolean]

        Whether the construct can be a dictionary member or not.

      exception_member [boolean]

        Whether the construct can be an exception member or not.

      interface_member [boolean]

        Whether the construct can be an interface member or not.

      keyword [string?]

        The primary keyword identifying the construct in Web IDL
        fragments, if any.  For example, |interface| for interfaces
        and partial interface definitions.

      name [string]

        The English name of the construct, as used in the Web IDL
        specification.

      reserved [object?]

        Reserved identifiers which cannot be used as an identifier of
        the construct, if any, represented as a JSON object whose
        names are identifiers and values are boolean true values.

  extended_attributes [object]

    Names are extended attribute names and values are their
    descriptions, represented as JSON objects with following
    name/value pairs:

      args [object]

        Allowed syntaxes of extended attribute arguments.  Names are
        one of following values and values are boolean true values, if
        that syntax is allowed:

          |no|          takes no arguments
          |args|        takes an argument list
          |named_args|  takes a named argument list
          |id|          takes an identifier
          |id_list|     takes an identifier list
          |pair|        takes a type pair

      disallowed_extended_attributes [object?]

        Extended attributes that cannot be used if this extended
        attribute is specified.  Names are extended attribute names
        and values are boolean true values.

      multiple [boolean]

        Whether the extended attribute can be specified multiple times
        for a construct or not.

  keyword_tokens [object]

    Tokens that are otherwise recognized as an |identifier| token.
    Names are literal values of tokens and values are JSON objects
    with following name/value pairs:

      argument_name [boolean]

        Whether the token is in the |ArgumentNameKeyword| production
        rule
        <http://heycam.github.io/webidl/#prod-ArgumentNameKeyword> or
        not.

      attribute_name [boolean]

        Whether the token is in the |AttributeNameKeyword| production
        rule
        <http://heycam.github.io/webidl/#prod-AttributeNameKeyword> or
        not.

  other_tokens [object]

    Tokens that are otherwise recognized as an |other| token.  Names
    are literal values of tokens and values are boolean true values.

  tokens [object]

    Tokens in Web IDL fragments.  Names of the object are token names
    and values of the object are their descriptions, which are JSON
    objects with following name/value pairs:

      priority [number]

        The priority in token types in the |tokens| object, which
        should be taken into account when the input is examined with
        those token types in order.  Token types with larger
        priorities should be examined first.

      pattern [string?]

        A Perl regular expression for the token.

      value [string?]

        The exact string that should generate this token.

    Exactly one of |pattern| and |value| is specified.  Note that this
    object does not contain token types in |keyword_tokens| and
    |other_tokens|.
