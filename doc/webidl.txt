This file contains data on Web IDL.

* Structure

The file contains following name/value pairs:

  keyword_tokens [object]

    Tokens that are otherwise recognized as an |identifier| token.
    Names are literal values of tokens and values are JSON objects
    with following name/value pair:

      argument_name [boolean]

        Whether the token is in the |ArgumentNameKeyword| production
        rule
        <http://heycam.github.io/webidl/#prod-ArgumentNameKeyword> or
        not.

  other_tokens [object]

    Tokens that are otherwise recognized as an |other| token.  Names
    are literal values of tokens and values are boolean true values.

  tokens [object]

    Tokens in Web IDL fragments.  Names of the object are token names
    and values of the object are their descriptions, which are JSON
    objects with following name/value pairs:

      priority [number]

        The priority in token types in the |tokens| object, which
        should be taken into account when the input is examined with
        those token types in order.  Token types with larger
        priorities should be examined first.

      pattern [string?]

        A Perl regular expression for the token.

      value [string?]

        The exact string that should generate this token.

    Exactly one of |pattern| and |value| is specified.  Note that this
    object does not contain token types in |keyword_tokens| and
    |other_tokens|.
