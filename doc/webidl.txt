This file contains data on Web IDL.

* Structure

The file contains following name/value pairs:

  constructs [object]

    Constructs appear in Web IDL fragments.  Names are short strings
    identifying constructs, and values are their descriptions,
    represented as JSON objects with following name/value pairs:

      allowed_extended_attributes [object?]

        Extended attributes allowed for this construct, if any.  Names
        are extended attribute names and values are boolean true
        values.

      definition [boolean]

        Whether the construct is a definition (i.e. a top-level
        construct) in Web IDL or not.

      dictionary_member [boolean]

        Whether the construct can be a dictionary member or not.

      exception_member [boolean]

        Whether the construct can be an exception member or not.

      interface_member [boolean]

        Whether the construct can be an interface member or not.

      keyword [string?]

        The primary keyword identifying the construct in Web IDL
        fragments, if any.  For example, |interface| for interfaces
        and partial interface definitions.

      name [string]

        The English name of the construct, as used in the Web IDL
        specification.

      object_type [boolean]

        Whether the type defined by this construct is an object type
        or not.

      reserved [object?]

        Reserved identifiers which cannot be used as an identifier of
        the construct, if any, represented as a JSON object whose
        names are identifiers and values are boolean true values.

      string_type [boolean]

        Whether the type defined by this construct is a string type or
        not.

  extended_attributes [object]

    Names are extended attribute names and values are their
    descriptions, represented as JSON objects with following
    name/value pairs:

      args [object]

        Allowed syntaxes of extended attribute arguments.  Names are
        one of following values and values are boolean true values, if
        that syntax is allowed:

          |no|          takes no arguments
          |args|        takes an argument list
          |named_args|  takes a named argument list
          |id|          takes an identifier
          |id_list|     takes an identifier list
          |pair|        takes a type pair

      disallowed_extended_attributes [object?]

        Extended attributes that cannot be used if this extended
        attribute is specified.  Names are extended attribute names
        and values are boolean true values.

      multiple [boolean]

        Whether the extended attribute can be specified multiple times
        for a construct or not.

  keyword_tokens [object]

    Tokens that are otherwise recognized as an |identifier| token.
    Names are literal values of tokens and values are JSON objects
    with following name/value pairs:

      argument_name [boolean]

        Whether the token is in the |ArgumentNameKeyword| production
        rule
        <http://heycam.github.io/webidl/#prod-ArgumentNameKeyword> or
        not.

      attribute_name [boolean]

        Whether the token is in the |AttributeNameKeyword| production
        rule
        <http://heycam.github.io/webidl/#prod-AttributeNameKeyword> or
        not.

  other_tokens [object]

    Tokens that are otherwise recognized as an |other| token.  Names
    are literal values of tokens and values are boolean true values.

  tokens [object]

    Tokens in Web IDL fragments.  Names of the object are token names
    and values of the object are their descriptions, which are JSON
    objects with following name/value pairs:

      priority [number]

        The priority in token types in the |tokens| object, which
        should be taken into account when the input is examined with
        those token types in order.  Token types with larger
        priorities should be examined first.

      pattern [string?]

        A Perl regular expression for the token.

      value [string?]

        The exact string that should generate this token.

    Exactly one of |pattern| and |value| is specified.  Note that this
    object does not contain token types in |keyword_tokens| and
    |other_tokens|.

  types [object]

    Web IDL types other than various "compound" and "special" types
    (might be expanded later to cover more types).  Names are keywords
    of types (where types with more than one keywords using a U+0020
    character as the separator).  Values are corresponding
    descriptions, as JSON objects with following name/value pairs:

      allowed_extended_attributes [object?]

        Extended attributes allowed for this type, if any.  Names are
        extended attribute names and values are boolean true values.

      buffer_source_type [boolean]

        Whether the type is a buffer source type or not.

      exception_type [boolean]

        Whether the type is an exception type
        <https://github.com/heycam/webidl/commit/faaee577b0c0c03338b139754835ac999de507be>
        or not.

      integer_type [boolean]

        Whether the type is an integer type or not.

      numeric_type [boolean]

        Whether the type is a numeric type or not.

      object_type [boolean]

        Whether the type is an object type or not.

      primitive_type [boolean]

        Whether the type is a primitive type or not.

      string_type [boolean]

        Whether the type is a string type or not.

      typed_array_type [boolean]

        Whether the type is a typed array type or not.
