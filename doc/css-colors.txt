* Structure

The file contains a JSON object with following name/value pairs:

  keywords [object]

    CSS <color> keywords except for named colors and system colors.
    Names of the object are color keywords in lowercase canonical
    form.  Values of the object are properties of them, represented as
    JSON objects with following name/value pairs:

      conforming [boolean]

        Whether the color keyword is conforming or not.

      outline_only [boolean]

        Whether the color keyword is only applied to the
        'outline-color' property or not.

  named_colors [object]

    CSS named color keywords, except for 'transparent' and
    'currentcolor'.  Names of the object are color names in lowercase
    canonical form.  Values of the object are colors, represented as
    JSON arrays containing R, G, and B number components of the RGB
    color.

  system_colors [object]

    CSS system color keywords (deprecated).  Names of the object are
    color names in lowercase canonical form.  Values of the object are
    descriptions of them, represented as JSON objects with following
    name/value pairs:

      camelcase_name [string]

        The CamelCase representation (which was encouraged in CSS2
        age) of the color name keyword.

      conforming [boolean]

        Whether the color keyword is conforming or not.

      foreground [string?]

        If the color is intended for the background color, the
        lowercase keyword of the color intended to be used in
        combination as the foreground color.

      typical

        Typical color for the keyword, represented as JSON arrays
        containing R, G, and B number components of the RGB color.

      win32

        Typical mapping to the Win32 API function |GetSysColor|, if
        known.  The value is represented as a JSON array, where the
        first item is the constant name string and the second item is
        the constant value, used as the argument to the function.
