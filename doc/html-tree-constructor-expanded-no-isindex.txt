~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file contains a description of the HTML tree construction
specification, derived from |data/html-syntax.json| (see
|doc/html-syntax.txt|) by expanding some definitions into sequences of
more primitive operations, and removing support for the |isindex|
element.

See also |data/html-tree-constructor-expanded.json|'s documentation.
