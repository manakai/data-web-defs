data/http-status-codes.json
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The file contains properties of known status codes used in HTTP and
derived protocols.

* Structure

The file contains a JSON object, whose members are status codes.
Their corresponding values contain descriptions for the status code.

  conflict [boolean]

    If true, there are some conflict for the usage of the status code.
    For example, different protocols might assign different
    reason-phrase with the same status code, or in fact their
    semantics could be different.  In addition, sometimes the same
    status code is used for different purposes even in a single
    protocol.

  http [object?]
  icap [object?]
  s-http [object?]
  sip [object?]
  ssdp [object?]

    Properties of the status code in HTTP, ICAP, S-HTTP, SSDP, or SIP,
    as a JSON object with following name/value pair:

      cacheable [boolean]

        Whether a response with the status code is cacheable or not.

      deprecated [boolean]

        Whether the status code is deprecated or not.

      id [id-in-spec?]

        The ID in the relevant specification, if any.

      multistatus [conformance?]

        Conformance of the use of the status code as the status of a
        207 multistatus entry, if known.

      null_body [boolean]

        Whether the status is a null body status
        <https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#null-body-status> or not.

      obsolete [boolean]

        Whether the status code is obsolete or not.

      reserved [boolean]

        Whether the status code is explicitly reserved or not.

      redirect [string?]

        Whether the automatic redirect using the value of the
        |Location:| header is allowed according to the HTTP RFCs or
        not.  If the value is |true|, it is allowed.  Otherwise, if
        the value is |false|, it is NOT allowed.  Otherwise, if the
        status code is 3xx, it is allowed.  Otherwise, it is NOT
        allowed.  See also |redirect_status| field.

      redirect_status [boolean]

        Whether the status is a redirect status
        <https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#redirect-status> or not.

      response [conformance?]

        Conformance of the use of the status code as the status of a
        response, if known.

      spec [spec?]

        The relevant specification, if any.

  iana [object?]

    A JSON object, representing whether the status code is listed in
    the IANA register or not.  Members of the object are names of the
    protocol of the IANA registry.  Their corresponding values are
    boolean.

  protocols [object?]

    A JSON object, representing the list of relevant protocols.
    Members of the object are names of the protocols for which the
    status code is defined.  Their corresponding values are the
    typical reason-phrase of the status code within the protocol.

  reason [string]

    The typical reason-phrase for the status code.
