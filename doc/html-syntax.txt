HTML elements).

* Data structure

The file contains a JSON object, which contains following name/value
pairs:

  adjusted_mathml_attr_names [object]

    The attribute name fixup table, used in the steps to adjust MathML
    attributes
    <http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#adjust-mathml-attributes>.
    Names are original attribute names in HTML source, normalized to
    ASCII lowercase.  Values are corresponding attribute local names.

  adjusted_ns_attr_names [object]

    The attribute name fixup table, used in the steps to adjust
    foreign attributes
    <http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#adjust-foreign-attributes>.
    Names are original attribute names in HTML source, normalized to
    ASCII lowercase.  Values are arrays, where first items are
    namespace URLs of attributes and second items are arrays of
    namespace prefixes and local names of attributes.

  adjusted_svg_attr_names [object]

    The attribute name fixup table, used in the steps to adjust SVG
    attributes

    from the HTML Standard.  The object has following name/value
    pairs:

      char_sets [object]

        Character sets referenced in |states|.  Names of the object
        are set names used in |states| and values are JSON objects,
        whose names are the shortest decimal representations of the
        code points in the set and values are boolean true values.

      states [object]
