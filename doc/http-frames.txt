~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The file contains data on HTTP/2 and WebSocket protocols.

* Structure

The file contains a JSON object with following name/value pairs:

  hpack [object]

    A JSON object containing following name/value pairs:

      huffman

        The static Huffman code table used in HPACK.  A JSON array
        whose item indexes are Huffman code table's index values
        (0-256) and items are following name/value pairs:

          bits [string]

            A string representing the bit representation of the code,
            MSB first.

          hex [string]

            A string representing the uppercase hexadecimal
            representation of the code as an unsigned 32-bit integer.
            The most significant bits of the integer with length of
            the |length| field is the code.

          length [integer]

            The number of the bits of the code.

      static

        The static table used in HPACK.  A JSON array whose indexes
        are indexes in the table and values are JSON arrays, whose
        first item is the header name and second item is the header
        value.  Note that there is no item with index 0.

  http2 [object]

    A JSON object containing following name/value pairs:

      error_codes [object]

        Names are known HTTP/2 error codes (in decimal with no leading
        zero) and values are their descriptions as [protocol-object],
        with following additional name/value pairs:

          code [integer]

            The error code.

          connection_error [boolean]

            Whether the error code is known to be used to represent a
            connection error.

          name [string]

            The error code name.

          stream_error [boolean]

            Whether the error code is known to be used to represent a
            stream error.

      settings [object]

        Names are known HTTP/2 setting identifiers (in decimal with no
        leading zero) and values are their descriptions as
        [protocol-object], with following additional name/value pairs:

          code [integer]

            The identifier.

          initial_infinity [boolean]

            Whether the initial value is "unlimited" or not.

          initial_integer [integer]

            The initial value, as an integer.

          name [string?]

            The setting name, if assigned.

  ws [object]

    A JSON object containing following name/value pairs:

      extensions [object]

        Names are known WebSocket extension names and values are their
        descriptions as [protocol-object], with following additional
        name/value pair:

          name [string]

            The extension name.

      protocols [object]

        Names are known WebSocket subprotocol names and values are
        their descriptions as [protocol-object], with following
        additional name/value pair:

          name [string]

            The subprotocol name.

      status_codes [object]

        Names are known WebSocket status codes (in decimal with no
        leading zero) and values are their descriptions as
        [protocol-object], with following additional name/value pairs:

          close [boolean]

            Whether the status code can be specified (i.e. is
            conforming to specify) in a WebSocket Protocol Close
            frame.

          code [integer]

            The WebSocket status code.
