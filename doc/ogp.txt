This file contains data on OGP.

* Structure

The file contains a JSON object with following name/value pairs:

  prefixes [object]

    Names are known prefixes of common properties and values are
    boolean true values.

  props [object]

    Names are common property names and values are their descriptions,
    represented as JSON objects with following name/value pairs:

      aliases [object?]

        Names are other properties with same semantics and values are
        boolean true values.

      array [boolean]

        Whether the property is defined as an array or not.  (If true,
        there can be multiple |meta| elements with this property.)

      array_item [boolean]

        Whether the property belongs to another property which is an
        array.  (If true, there can be multiple |meta| elements with
        this property.)

      deprecated [boolean]

        Whether the property is deprecated or not.

      enums [object]

        Names are possible values and values are boolean true values.
        If specified, the |content| attribute value of a |meta|
        element whose |property| attribute value is this property must
        be one of names.  Note that a name can be the empty string.

      requires [object?]

        Names are property names and values are boolean true values.
        If there is a |meta| element with this property, there must
        also be |meta| elements with properties specified as names.

      target_type [object?]

        Names are |og:type| values and/or |*| and values are boolean
        true values.  The property must be combined with a |meta|
        element whose |property| is |og:type| and |content| is one of
        names (or can be any value if there is |*|).

      value_type [value-type?]

        Data type for the |content| attribute of the |meta| element
        whose |property| attribute value is this property, if known.

  types [object]

    Names are |og:type| values or |*| (which represents "any" or "all"
    types) and values are their descriptions, represented as JSON
    objects with following name/value pair:

      requires [object?]

        Names are property names and values are boolean true values.
        If the |og:type| of a document is this type, there must be
        |meta| elements with properties specified as names.

  units [object]

    Names are possible units and values are boolean true values.
    These are possible "OGP unit" values.
