isindex-prompt.json
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file contains default prompt texts (inserted into the DOM by the
HTML parser) for the HTML |isindex| start tag.

* Structure

The file contains a JSON object, whose name/value pairs are locale
identifiers and corresponding objects.

Locale identifiers are represented by BCP 47 language tags, lowercase
normalized.  At the time of writing, locale identifiers are
represented by two or three letter language subtags, optionally
followed by "-" and two or three letter region subtags (with an
exception: "ja-jp-mac").

JSON objects for the locales might contain names "chromium" and
"gecko".  If specified, their values are prompt texts from Chromium
and Gecko repositories, respectively, for the locale.  Note that most
(but not all) Gecko texts contain trailing space character, while
Chromium texts do not.

Sometimes Chromium and Gecko have different sets of locale variants.
For example, Chromium has only "bn" while Gecko has "bn-bd" and
"bn-in".

Note that HTML Standard's English text is "This is a searchable
index. Enter search keywords: ".
