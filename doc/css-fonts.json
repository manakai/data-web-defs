* Structure

This file contains a JSON object with following name/value pairs:

  aa_2ch_font_family

    A JSON array of strings, which can be used to construct a
    'font-family' property value suitable for rendering of 2ch-style
    AAs (ASCII arts) <http://www.paw.hi-ho.ne.jp/mistletoe/AAw.htm>.
    Note that order of font names in the array might be significant.

  font_family_keywords [object]

    Names of the object are keywords representing font families, other
    than generic font families, in lowercase canonical form.  Values
    of the object are their properties, represented as objects with
    following name/value pair:

      conforming [boolean]

        Whether the keyword is conforming or not.

  generic_font_families [object]

    Names of the object are generic font family keywords, in lowercase
    canonical form.  Values of the object are their properties,
    represented as objects with following name/value pair:

      conforming [boolean]

        Whether the keyword is conforming or not.

  system_fonts [object]

    Names of the object are system font keywords, in lowercase
    canonical form.  Values of the object are their properties,
    represented as objects with following name/value pair:

      conforming [boolean]

        Whether the keyword is conforming or not.

      win32

        Mapping to the Win32 API invocation, if known.  If specified,
        the value is a JSON array with two or three items.  The first
        and second items represent the /uiParam/ parameter value for
        the |SystemParametersInfo| function for the system color, as
        constant name string and constant number value,
        representively.  If there are only two items, the |LOGFONT|
        structure for the system font can be obtained by the
        invocation of the function with the parameter.  If there are
        three items, the |NONCLIENTMETRICS| structure can be obtained
        by the invocation of the function with the parameter.  Then
        the |LOGFONT| structure for the system font can be obtained by
        accessing the structure member whose name is equal to the
        third item.
