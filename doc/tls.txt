    are their descriptions as [protocol-object], with following
    additional name/value pairs:

      hex [string]

        The uppercase Base16 representation of the protocol ID.

      string [string]

        The ASCII string representation of the protocol ID.

  cipher_suites [object]

    Names are known cipher suite codes (in decimal with no leading
    zero) and values are their descriptions as [protocol-object], with
    following additional name/value pairs:

      code [integer]

        The cipher suite code.

      dtls [boolean]

        Whether the cipher suite can be used in DTLS or not.

      gnutls [string?]

        The cipher suite name used in GnuTLS.

      h2_blacklist [boolean]

        Whether the cipher suite is part of the HTTP/2 cipher suite
        black list or not.

      h2_required [boolean]

        Whether support for the cipher suite is required by HTTP/2 or
        not.

      name [string?]

        The cipher suite name, as registered with IANA.

      nss [string?]

        The cipher suite name used in NSS.

      openssl [string?]

        The cipher suite name used in OpenSSL.

      tls12_recommended [boolean]

        Whether support for the cipher suite is recommended in TLS 1.2
        or not, according to RFC 7525.

      tls12_required [boolean]
