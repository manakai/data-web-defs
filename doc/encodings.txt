encodings.json
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file contains data on character encodings for the Web.

* Structure

The file contains a JSON object containing following data:

locale_default [object]

  Locale-dependent default encoding as suggested by
  <http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#determining-the-character-encoding>.
  The names represent locales, identified by BCP 47 language tags, in
  lowercase.  The values represent the corresponding encoding labels
  in the Encoding Standard, in lowercase.  The name "*" represents the
  fallback, i.e. the default encoding used when the current locale is
  not otherwise listed.

supported_labels [object]

  List of all supported encoding labels for the Web platform, as
  specified by the Encoding Standard.  The object contains name/value
  pairs where names are encoding labels (in lowercase non white space
  surrounded canonical form) and values are encoding names of the
  corresponding labels.  Note that the encoding name might not be a
  valid label (at the time of writing, the only such encoding is
  "replacement").  According to the Encoding Standard, only the
  "utf-8" label is conforming.  This list does not (and will not)
  contain labels not in the Encoding Standard.
