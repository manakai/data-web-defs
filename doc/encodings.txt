encodings.json
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file contains data on character encodings for the Web.

* Structure

The file contains a JSON object with following name/value pairs:

  html_decl_map [object]

    A JSON object whose names and values are encoding names (not
    encoding labels!).  When interpreting an HTML character encoding
    declaration, an encoding name that is one of names must be
    replaced by the encoding name in the corresponding value,
    according to the prescan algorithm
    <http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#prescan-a-byte-stream-to-determine-its-encoding>
    and the change the encoding algorithm
    <http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#change-the-encoding>.

  locale_default [object]

    Locale-dependent default encoding as suggested by
    <http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#determining-the-character-encoding>.
    The names represent locales, identified by BCP 47 language tags,
    in lowercase.  The values represent the corresponding encoding
    labels in the Encoding Standard, in lowercase.  The name "*"
    represents the fallback, i.e. the default encoding used when the
    current locale is not otherwise listed.

  supported_labels [object]

    List of all supported encoding labels for the Web platform, as
    specified by the Encoding Standard.  The object contains
    name/value pairs where names are encoding labels (in lowercase non
    white space surrounded canonical form) and values are encoding
    names of the corresponding labels.  Note that the encoding name
    might not be a valid label (at the time of writing, the only such
    encoding is "replacement").  According to the Encoding Standard,
    only the "utf-8" label is conforming.  This list does not (and
    will not) contain labels not in the Encoding Standard.
