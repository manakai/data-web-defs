data/encodings.json
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file contains data on character encodings for the Web.

* Structure

The file contains a JSON object with following name/value pairs:

  encodings [object]

    Names are the keys of the encodings and values are their
    descriptions, as [protocol-object] with following additional
    name/value pairs:

      compat_name [string]

        The name of the encoding returned by |characterSet| and
        |inputEncoding| attributes of the |Document| interface.  It is
        same value as the |name| field.

      html_decl_mapped [string?]

        The key of the mapped encoding used in HTML character encoding
        declaration, if any.  If a string is set, when the encoding is
        specified by an HTML character encoding declaration, it is
        interpreted as the encoding identified by the string instead
        by the prescan algorithm
        <https://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#prescan-a-byte-stream-to-determine-its-encoding>
        and the change the encoding algorithm
        <https://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#change-the-encoding>.

      key [string]

        A short string identifying the encoding.  It is same as |name|
        but lowercased.

      labels [object]

        Names are the labels of the encoding, in lowercase, and values
        are boolean true values.

      name [object]

        The name of the encoding.

  html_decl_map [object]

    A JSON object whose names and values are encoding keys (not
    encoding names or labels!).  When interpreting an HTML character
    encoding declaration, an encoding that is one of names must be
    replaced by the encoding in the corresponding value, according to
    the prescan algorithm
    <https://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#prescan-a-byte-stream-to-determine-its-encoding>
    and the change the encoding algorithm
    <https://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#change-the-encoding>.

  locale_default [object]

    Locale-dependent default encoding as suggested by
    <https://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#determining-the-character-encoding>.
    The names represent locales, identified by BCP 47 language tags,
    in lowercase.  The values represent the corresponding encoding
    keys.  The name "*" represents the fallback, i.e. the default
    encoding used when the current locale is not otherwise listed.

  supported_labels [object]

    List of all supported encoding labels for the Web platform, as
    specified by the Encoding Standard.  The object contains
    name/value pairs where names are encoding labels (in lowercase
    with no surrounding white space characters) and values are
    encoding keys of the corresponding labels.  Note that the encoding
    key might not be a valid label (at the time of writing, the only
    such encoding is "replacement").

    Note that, according to the Encoding Standard, only the "utf-8"
    label is conforming.

    This list does not (and will not) contain labels not in the
    Encoding Standard.
