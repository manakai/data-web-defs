data/encodings.json
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file contains data on character encodings for the Web.

* Structure

The file contains a JSON object with following name/value pairs:

  encodings [object]

    Names are the keys of the encodings and values are their
    descriptions, as [protocol-object] with following additional
    name/value pairs:

      ascii_compat [boolean]

        Whether the encoding is an ASCII-compatible encoding
        <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-compatible-encoding> or
        not.

      compat_name [string]

        The name of the encoding returned by |characterSet| and
        |inputEncoding| attributes of the |Document| interface.  It is
        same value as the |name| field.

      conforming [boolean]

        Whether the encoding is conforming for authors or not.

      html_conformance [string]

        The conformance of the encoding for HTML authors, according to
        the HTML5 specification.  One of following values:

          good        The encoding that SHOULD be used.
          avoid       The encoding that is not a "SHOULD be used" encoding.
          bad         The encoding SHOULD NOT be used.
          broken      The encoding cannot be used by definition.

        Note that the current HTML Standard requires the use of UTF-8.

      html_decl_mapped [string]

        The key of the mapped encoding used in HTML character encoding
        declaration, as used by the prescan algorithm
        <https://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#prescan-a-byte-stream-to-determine-its-encoding>
        and the change the encoding algorithm
        <https://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#change-the-encoding>.

      key [string]

        A short string identifying the encoding.  It is same as |name|
        but lowercased.

      labels [object]

        Names are the labels of the encoding, in lowercase, and values
        are [protocol-object]s with following additional name/value
        pair:

          conforming [boolean]

            Whether the label is conforming for authors or not.

      name [object]

        The name of the encoding.

      output [string]

        The key of the encoding that would be returned by applying the
        "get an output encoding" steps
        <https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#get-an-output-encoding> to
        the encoding.

      single_byte [boolean]

        Whether the encoding is a single-byte encoding whose 0x00-0x7F
        is mapped to the ASCII characters.

        See also |doc/encoding-indexes.txt|.

      single_byte_decode [string?]

        If specified, the encoding is a single-byte encoding and the
        index data file has an index whose name is the value of this
        field, which can be used as the index of 256 bit combinations
        for the decoder of this encoding.  See also
        |doc/encoding-indexes.txt|.

      single_byte_encode [string?]

        If specified, the encoding is a single-byte encoding and the
        index data file has an index whose name is the value of this
        field, which can be used as the index of 256 bit combinations
        for the encoder of this encoding.  See also
        |doc/encoding-indexes.txt|.

      utf16 [boolean]

        Whether the encoding is a UTF-16 encoding
        <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#utf-16-encoding> or not.

      web [boolean]

        Whether the encoding is for the Web (e.g. HTML) or not.

        In this data file, some additional encodings not documented in
        the Encoding Standard are marked as "web".  This is willful
        violation to the Encoding Standard and the HTML Standard,
        which prohibit supporting of non-standard character encodings,
        motivated by desire to have implementations be compatible with
        existing Web content.

      zip [boolean]

        Whether the encoding is for the ZIP file names or not.

  html_decl_map [object]

    A JSON object whose names and values are encoding keys (not
    encoding names or labels!).  When interpreting an HTML character
    encoding declaration, an encoding that is one of names must be
    replaced by the encoding in the corresponding value, according to
    the prescan algorithm
    <https://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#prescan-a-byte-stream-to-determine-its-encoding>
    and the change the encoding algorithm
    <https://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#change-the-encoding>.

  locale_default [object]

    Locale-dependent default character encoding for HTML encoding
    sniffing algorithm, as suggested by
    <https://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#determining-the-character-encoding>,
    amended according to
    <https://wiki.suikawiki.org/n/%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B1%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB%E7%AD%89%E3%81%AB%E3%82%88%E3%82%8B%E6%96%87%E5%AD%97%E3%82%B3%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89%E5%88%A4%E5%AE%9A%E3%81%AE%E8%A3%9C%E5%8A%A9>
    to reflect Web reality better.
    
    The names represent locales, identified by BCP 47 language tags,
    in lowercase.  The values represent the corresponding encoding
    keys.  The name "*" represents the fallback, i.e. the default
    encoding used when the current locale is not otherwise listed.

  supported_labels [object]

    List of all supported encoding labels for the Web platform.  The
    object contains name/value pairs where names are encoding labels
    (in lowercase with no surrounding white space characters) and
    values are encoding keys of the corresponding labels.

    Note that, according to the Encoding Standard, only the "utf-8"
    label is conforming.

    Old version of this document had claimed that this list does not
    (and will not) contain labels not in the Encoding Standard.
    However, for Web compatibility, this list now contains additional
    encoding labels not defined by the Encoding Standard.

  zip_locale_default [object]

    Locale-dependent default character encoding for ZIP file name
    encoding sniffing algorhithm.  Similar data structure to
    |locale_default|.
