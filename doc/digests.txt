~~~~~~~~~~~~

The file contains list of digest algorithms.

* Structure

The file contains a JSON object with following name/value pairs:

  algorihtms [object]

    Keys are algorithm names (in lowercase for HTTP values; as is for
    |ni:| values) and values are JSON objects which contains
    name/value pairs whose name is |HTTP| (HTTP |Digest:| and
    |Want-Digest:| headers), |Digest| (HTTP |Digest| authentication),
    or |ni| (|ni:| and |nih:| URLs) and values are their descriptions
    as [protocol-object], with following additional name/value pairs:

      Digest [boolean]

        Whether the algorithm name can be specified in the HTTP
        |Digest:| header or not.

      name [string]

        The canonical name of the algorithm, as used in relevant
        specifications or registries.

      name_sess [string]

        The canonical name of the algorithm with "-sess" suffix, used
        in HTTP Digest authentication's |algorithm| parameter, if any.

      required [boolean]

        Whether the support for the algorithm is required or not.

      suite_id [number?]

        The Suite ID of the algorithm, as used in |ni:| and |nih:|
        URLs.

      value_length [number?]

        The length of the value encoded by the algorithm, if known, in
        bits.

      value_syntax [string?]

        The syntax of the value encoded by the algorithm, if known,
        using one of followings:

          base16    Zero or more ASCII hexadecimal digits (case-insensitive).
          base64    Base64 encoded byte sequence.
          digits    Zero or more ASCII digits.

      Want-Digest [boolean]

        Whether the algorithm name can be specified in the HTTP
        |Want-Digest:| header or not.

  ni_suite_ids [object]

    Names are Suite IDs used or reserved in |ni:| URLs and values are
    their descriptions, as [protocol-object], with following
    name/value pair:

      name [string?]

        The name of the algorithm, if assigned.
