          request [object?]

            Conformance of the existence of the header in an HTTP
            request message.  The effective value of this field for an
            HTTP request message whose method is /method/ can be
            obtained by following steps:

              1. If there is a name/value pair whose name is /method/,
                 return the value and abort these steps.

              2. Otherwise, if there is a name/value pair whose name
                 is |*|, return the value and abort these steps.

              3. Otherwise, return nothing.

            If the return value is a |conformance| value, it is the
            conformance of the existence of the header in that
            context.  Otherwise, the header is not known to be
            applicable to request messages.

          request_context [boolean]

            <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.5> or not.

          request_modifier [boolean]

            Whether the header is classified as request modifier

          response [object?]

            Conformance of the existence of the header in an HTTP
            response message.  The effective value of this field for
            an HTTP response message whose status code is three digits
            |/l//m//n/| can be obtained by following steps:

              1. If there is a name/value pair whose name is
                 |/l//m//n/|, return the value and abort these steps.

              2. Otherwise, if there is a name/value pair whose name
                 is |/l/xx|, return the value and abort these steps.

              3. Otherwise, if there is a name/value pair whose name
                 is |xxx|, return the value and abort these steps.

              4. Otherwise, return nothing.

            If the return value is a |conformance| value, it is the
            conformance of the existence of the header in that
            context.  Otherwise, the header is not known to be
            applicable to response messages.
