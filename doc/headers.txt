headers.json
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The file contains data on headers in various RFC 822 derived message
formats.

* Structure

The file contains a JSON object with following name/value pair:

  headers [object]

    Names are header names in lowercase (without |:| suffix) and
    values are their descriptions.  Values are JSON objects with
    following name/value pairs:

      http [object?]

        Descriptions for the header, when used in HTTP.  The value is
        a JSON object with following name/value pairs:

          authentication [boolean]

            Whether the header is classified as authentication
            according to
            <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-4.1.2> or
            not.

          connection_option [boolean]

            Whether the header name is used as a |connection-option|
            (i.e. a value in the |Connection:| header) or not.

          id [id-in-spec?]

            The ID in the relevant specification, if any.

          message_framing [boolean]

            Whether the header is used for message framing according
            to <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-4.1.2> or
            not.

          multiple [boolean]

            Whether the header can be used multiple times in a message
            or not.

          not_for_http10 [boolean]

            Whether the header is allowed in HTTP/1.0 or not.

          not_for_trailer [boolean]

            Whether the header cannot be used in trailers according to
            <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-4.1.2> or
            not.

          payload_processing [boolean]

            Whether the header is used to determine how to process the
            payload according to
            <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-4.1.2> or
            not.

          request [object?]

            Conformance of the existence of the header in an HTTP
            request message.  The effective value of this field for an
            HTTP request message whose method is /method/ can be
            obtained by following steps:

              1. If there is a name/value pair whose name is /method/,
                 return the value and abort these steps.

              2. Otherwise, if there is a name/value pair whose name
                 is |*|, return the value and abort these steps.

              3. Otherwise, return nothing.

            If the return value is one of RFC 2119 keywords |MUST|,
            |MUST NOT|, |SHOULD|, |SHOULD NOT|, or |MAY|, it is the
            conformance of the header.  Otherwise, if the return value
            is the empty string, the conformance cannot be represented
            as a value or the conformance is not known.  Otherwise,
            the header is not known to be applicable to request
            messages.

          request_modifier [boolean]

            Whether the header is classified as request modifier
            according to
            <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-4.1.2> or
            not.

          response [object?]

            Conformance of the existence of the header in an HTTP
            response message.  The effective value of this field for
            an HTTP response message whose status code is three digits
            |/l//m//n/| can be obtained by following steps:

              1. If there is a name/value pair whose name is
                 |/l//m//n/|, return the value and abort these steps.

              2. Otherwise, if there is a name/value pair whose name
                 is |/l/xx|, return the value and abort these steps.

              3. Otherwise, if there is a name/value pair whose name
                 is |xxx|, return the value and abort these steps.

              4. Otherwise, return nothing.

            If the return value is one of RFC 2119 keywords |MUST|,
            |MUST NOT|, |SHOULD|, |SHOULD NOT|, or |MAY|, it is the
            conformance of the header.  Otherwise, if the return value
            is the empty string, the conformance cannot be represented
            as a value or the conformance is not known.  Otherwise,
            the header is not known to be applicable to response
            messages.

          response_control_data [boolean]

            Whether the header is classified as response control data
            according to
            <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-4.1.2> or
            not.

          routing [boolean]

            Whether the header is used for routing according to
            <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-4.1.2> or
            not.

          spec [spec?]

            The relevant specification, if any.

          value_is_list [string?]

            If the value is |*|, the value of the header is defined as
            a list of zero or more values (i.e. by ABNF |#| syntax).
            Otherwise, if the value is |+|, the value of the header is
            defined as a list of one or more values (i.e. by ABNF |1#|
            syntax).  Otherwise, the value of the header is not
            defined as a list.

          value_type [value-type?]

            The type of the header value, if known and representable
            as a value type.  If the header value is defined as a
            list, this filed has the type of its items.

      name [string]

        The name of the header in canonical form (i.e. the form shown
        in the relevant specification, if any, or titlecased form).
