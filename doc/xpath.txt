This file contains data on XPath.

* Structure

The file contains a JSON object with following name/value pair:

  functions [object]

    Names are namespace URL or "" for null namespace and values are
    JSON objects, whose names are function names in that namespace and
    values are their descriptions, represented as JSON objects with
    following name/value pairs:

      args

        A JSON array containing XPath type names of the arguments
        accepted by the function, in order.  If the function accepts
        infinite number of arguments, last arguments must be of type
        shown in the last item in the array.  Array items are one of
        following values: |boolean|, |number|, |string|, |node-set|,
        or |object|.

      args_min [number]

        Minimum number of arguments required by the function.

      args_max [number]

        Maximum number of arguments allowed by the function.  The
        value can be "Infinity".

      context [object?]

        Names are allowed context and values are boolean true values.
        Currently, the only available context is "core".  If a
        function is in "core" set, it is available in all XPath
        evaluations.

      id [id-in-spec?]

        The ID of the function in the specification.

      return_type [string]

        The data type of the return value of the function.  It must be
        one of following values: |boolean|, |number|, |string|,
        |node-set|, or |object|.

      spec [spec?]

        The ID of the specification in which the function is defined.
