type [string]

  The type of the value, one of:

    |type|              A type used in type/subtype pair, followed by |/*|.
    |subtype|           A type/subtype pair.
    |type_only|         The (non-conforming) type value, used alone with
                        no following subtype.  Some of values of this type
                        come from RFC 1049.
    |type_only_pattern| Same as |type_only| but represents a set of types
                        rather than a single type, using |*| as wildcard.
    |suffix|            |*/*+| followed by a structured syntax suffix.
