encoding-indexes.json
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file is a set of indexes that are used to implement encoding and
decoding of character encodings.

* Structure

The file contains a JSON object, where names are index names and
values are corresponding indexes.

An index is an array of values.

A value is a null value, a non-negative integer, or an array of one or
more non-negative integers.

Most of indexes are those defined by the Encoding Standard.

This file also has indexes for encodings not defined by the Encoding
Standard.  The index names describe the relevant encoding, with the
exception of |tcvn-encode| and |tcvn-decode|, which are to be used by
the encoder and the decoder of the x-viet-tcvn encoding.

Some of additional indexes has 256 values, which describes the 256 bit
combinations of a single-byte encoding.

Some of additional indexes has an array value.  It represents a
sequence of characters for the byte.
