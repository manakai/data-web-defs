data/aria.json
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file contains ARIA data.

See also |data/elements.json|, which contains ARIA semantics for
elements.

* Structure

The file contains a JSON object, with following name/value pairs:

attrs [object]

  Names are ARIA attribute names, i.e. state names and property names,
  with "aria-" prefix, in lowercase, while values are
  [protocol-object] of corresponding data, with following name/value
  pairs:

    default [string?]

      The default value, used when the attribute is missing.  Note
      that the value is not a token when the value can be multiple
      tokens.

    is_state [boolean]

      If true, the attribute is a state.  Otherwise, the attribute is
      a property.

    tokens [object?]

      Allowed tokens for the attribute value, if the attribute value
      is defined as token or tokens.  Names are values, while values
      are objects.  If the |value_type| is |eumerated|, the attribute
      value must be one of tokens.  If the |value_type| is |unordered
      set of unique space-separated tokens|, the words in the
      attribute value must be one of tokens.

    value_type [value-type]

      The type of the attribute value.

roles [object]

  Names are ARIA roles in lowercase while values are [protocol-object]
  of corresponding data, with following name/value pairs:

    abstract [boolean]

      Whether the role is an abstract role or not.

    accessible_name_required [boolean]

      Whether the "accessible name required" for the role is true or
      not.

    attr_default [object?]

      The implicit default attribute values, if any and the value is a
      string.  The names are attribute names, with "aria-" prefix and
      in lowercase, and values are corresponding default values.

    attrs [object?]

      Names are ARIA attribute names allowed for the role and values
      are corresponding data, with following name/value pairs:

        must [boolean]

          If true, the attribute must be specified.

        should [boolean]

          If true, the attribute should be specified.

    children_presentational [boolean]

      Whether the children presentational for the role is true or not.

    must_contain [object?]

      Any required owner elements of the role.  Names are role names
      and values are boolean true values.

    name_from [object?]

      The "name from" of the role.  Names are "author" (the "author"
      value) and "contents" (the "contents" or "content" value) and
      values are [boolean] true values.

    scope [object?]

      Any required context roles of the role.  Names are role names
      and values are boolean true values.

    subclass_of [object?]

      Any superclasses of the role.  Names are role names and values
      are distances of superclass relationships between the role and
      superclass roles.

    superclass_of [object?]

      Any subclasses of the role.  Names are role names and values are
      distances of subclass relationships between the role and
      subclass roles.
