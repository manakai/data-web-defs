Top-level domain names and public suffixes.

* Structure

The file contains a JSON object, which has the following name/value
pair:

  tld [object]

    Names are TLD labels, represented as lowercase A-labels, and
    values are their descriptions as [domain-object].

* The [domain-object] data structure

A [domain-object] data structure is a [protocol-object] with following
additional name/value pairs:

  iana [boolean]

    Whether the domain has officially endorsed by ICANN or not.

  mozilla_idn_whitelist [boolean]

    Whether the domain is in the Gecko's "network.IDN.whitelist.*"
    whitelist ("IDN-enabled TLDs" list) or not.  Note that this
    preference is obsolete.

  public_suffix [string?]

    Whether the domain is a public suffix or not.  If the value is
    |ICANN|, the domain is an ICANN domain in PSL.  If the value is
    |PRIVATE|, the domain is a PRIVATE domain in PSL.  Otherwise,
    i.e. if the value is |0|, or if has no value and no |*| fallback
    entry (see |subdomains| field), the domain is not a public suffix.

  subdomains [object?]

    Subdomains of the domain.  Names are domain labels of subdomains,
    represented as lowercase A-labels, and values are their
    descriptions.  The |*| label represents the "fallback" entry for
    the |public_suffix| fields.

  u [string?]

    The u-label of the domain label, if it is different from the
    A-label.
