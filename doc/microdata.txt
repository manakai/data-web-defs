~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file contains data for the microdata vocabularies.

* Structure

The file contains a JSON object, which is a name/value pairs where
names are item types and values are corresponding definitions.

Definitions of the item identified by the item types are JSON objects
with following name/value pairs:

  id [id-in-spec?]

    The ID in the specification, identified by |spec|, for the item
    type.

  label [string?]

    The human-readable name of the item type, if any.

  props [object?]

    The names are the defined property names for the item.  The values
    are JSON objects containing their definitions.  They contain
    following name/value pairs:

      enum [object?]

        If specified, the item value can be a text.  The value can be
        one of names in the JSON object.  Values in the JSON object
        contain definitions for the enumerated values, using following
        name/value pairs:

          id [id-in-spec?]

            The ID in the specification, identified by |spec|, for the
            value.

          spec [spec?]

            The specification in which the value is defined, if any.

      id [id-in-spec?]

        The ID in the specification, identified by |spec|, for the
        property.

      item [object?]

        If specified, the item value can be an item.  The object
        represents what kind of items can be specified.

        If the object has a name/value pair with name "type", the item
        can be an item whose item type is equal to the value.
        Otherwise, the item can be an item without item type, and the
        item has to conform to the definition recursively contained in
        the object.

      max [number]

        The maximum number of the property allowed for the item.  The
        value can be inifinity.

      min [number]

        The minimum umber of the property required for the item.

      spec [spec?]

        The specification in which the property is defined, if any.

      unique [boolean]

        If true, when the property is specified multiple times for an
        item, their values must be unique.

      url [boolean]

        If true, the item value can be an absolute URL.

      value [value-type?]

        If specified, the item value can be a text.  If the specified
        value is different from "text", the value must conform to the
        format identified by the specified value.

    Possible item values are represented by |enum|, |item|, |url|, and
    |value|.  If none of these values are specified, there is no
    restriction on the item value according to the relevant
    specification.

  spec [spec?]

    The specification in which the item type is defined, if any.

  url [string?]

    The URL of the specification in which the item type is defined, if
    known.
