data/mime-sniffing.json
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This JSON file contains data for MIME sniffing algorithms.

* Data

The file contains a JSON object with following name/value pairs:

apache_bug_content_types

  "Content-Type" header values flagging the "check-for-apache-bug
  flag"
  <https://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org/#supplied-mime-type-detection-algorithm>.
  An JSON array of JSON objects with following name/value pairs:

    chars [string]

      ASCII character string equivalent of the bytes.

    hex [string]

      Space (U+0020) separated sequence of two hexadecimal digits
      representing the bytes.

tables [object]

  Tables in definitions of sniffing steps.  The value is a JSON
  object, with following names:

    scriptable

      Table of the rules for identifying an unknown MIME type, step 1.

    non_scriptable

      Table of the rules for identifying an unknown MIME type, step 2,
      except for BOM patterns.

    bom1

      Table of the rules for identifying an unknown MIME type, step 2,
      BOM patterns.

    bom2

      Table equivalent to the BOM detecting steps of the rules for
      distinguishing if a resource is text or binary.

    image

      Table of the image type pattern matching algorithm.

    audio_or_video

      Table of the audio or video type pattern matching algorithm.

    font

      Table of font type pattern matching algorithm.

    archive

      Table of archive type pattern matching algorithm.

    text_track

      Table to sniff WebVTT.

  Their values are JSON objects with following name/value pairs:

    defs [object]

      A JSON array of JSON objects, each of which is corresponding to
      a row in the specification's definition table, with following
      name/value pairs:

        computed [string]

          The "Computed MIME Type".

        leading_ws [boolean]

          Whether the "Leading Bytes to Be Ignored" is "Whitespace
          bytes."  or not.

        mask [string]

          The "Pattern Mask", as space (U+0020) separated sequence of
          two hexadecimal digits representing bytes.

        pattern [string]

          The "Byte Pattern", as space (U+0020) separated sequence of
          two hexadecimal digits representing bytes.

        regexp [string]

          A regular expression that is equivalent to the pattern
          described by "leading_ws", "mask", and "pattern".

    regexps [object]

      Assembled regular expressions equivalent to "defs".  A JSON
      object whose names are computed MIME type and values are regular
      expressions matching will result in the corresponding computed
      MIME type.
