elements.json
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file contains data on HTML/XML elements.

* Structure

The file contains an object, whose names are namespace URLs.

Values corresponding to them are objects containing local names of
elements in the namespace, and/or "*", which represents the
"fallback".

Values corresponding to local names are objects containing properties
of the element:

  interface [string?]

    The element interface (see DOM Standard) for the element.  If this
    property has a value, it is the interface used for the element.
    Otherwise, if the "interface" property of the "*" local name in
    the same namespace has a value, it is the interface used for the
    element.  Otherwise, the |Element| interface is the used
    interface.
