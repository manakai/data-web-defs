~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file contains request methods used in HTTP and some derived
protocols.

* Structure

The file contains a JSON object, whose members are method names.
Their corresponding values are JSON objects containing methods'
properties, including:

  case_insensitive [boolean]

    Whether the method name is byte case-insensitive or not
    <http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-method-normalize>.

  iana [object?]

    List of the IANA registries in which the method is registered.
    Its members are pairs of protocol names and boolean value
    representing the appearence.

  idempotent [boolean]

    Whether the method is idempotent or not
    <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.2.2>.

  protocols [object?]

    List of the relevant protocols.  Its members are pairs of protocol
    names and boolean value representing the relevance of the
    protocol.

  safe [boolean]

    Whether the method is safe or not
    <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.2.1>.

  simple [boolean]

    Whether the method is a simple method
    <http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#simple-method> or not.

  wildcard [boolean]

    If true, it is not a method, but rather a set of methods sharing
    same name structure.  The |*| character is used as wildcard in the
    method name.

  xhr_insecure [boolean]

    Whether the method is forbidden or not
    <http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-forbidden-methods>.  Note
    that forbidden methods are byte case-insensitive.

  xhr_no_request_body [boolean]

    Whether the request-body cannot be sent by XHR or not
    <http://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-xmlhttprequest-send>.

  http [object?]
  icap [object?]
  s-http [object?]
  ssdp [object?]

    Properties of the request method in the protocol (|http| -> HTTP,
    |icap| -> ICAP, |s-http| -> S-HTTP, |ssdp| -> SSDP), as a JSON
    object with following name/value pairs:

      cacheable [boolean]

        Whether the method is cacheable or not
        <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.2.3>.

      id [id-in-spec?]

        The ID in the specification identified by |id| at which the
        method is defined, if known.

      ims [boolean]

        Whether the |If-Modified-Since:| header is applicable to this
        method and the |If-None-Match:| header will return a 304
        response rather than a 412 response.

      not_for_representation [boolean]

        Whether the request mtehod does not involve the selection or
        modification of a selected representation
        <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232#section-5>.

      range [boolean]

        Whether a range request is applicable to this method or not.

      request_body [string?]

        Whether the request body is allowed in a request message which
        has this method, if known.  One of following values:

          undefined   Semantics of the request body is undefined and
                      whether the request body is allowed or not is unclear.
          MAY         There can be a request body.
          MUST        There must be a request body, possibly zero-length.
          MUST NOT    There must not be a request body, even if zero-length.

      required [boolean]

        Whether support for the method is required for an HTTP server
        <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#page-22> or an ICAP
        server <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3507#section-4.3.2>.

      spec [spec?]

        The specification in which the method is defined, if known.
