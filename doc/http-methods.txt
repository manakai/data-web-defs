This file contains request methods used in HTTP and some derived
protocols.

* Structure

The file contains a JSON object, whose members are method names.
Their corresponding values are JSON objects containing methods'
properties, including:

  case_insensitive [boolean]

    Whether the method name is byte case-insensitive or not
    <http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-method-normalize>.

  iana [object?]

    List of the IANA registries in which the method is registered.
    Its members are pairs of protocol names and boolean value
    representing the appearence.

  idempotent [boolean]

    Whether the method is idempotent or not
    <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.2.2>.

  protocols [object?]

    method name.

  xhr_insecure [boolean]

    Whether the method is forbidden or not
    <http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-forbidden-methods>.  Note
    that forbidden methods are byte case-insensitive.

  xhr_no_request_body [boolean]

    Whether the request-body cannot be sent by XHR or not
    <http://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-xmlhttprequest-send>.

  http [object?]
  icap [object?]

    Properties of the request method in the protocol (|http| -> HTTP,
    |icap| -> ICAP), as a JSON object with following name/value pairs:

      cacheable [boolean]

        Whether the method is cacheable or not
        <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.2.3>.

      id [id-in-spec?]

        The ID in the specification identified by |id| at which the
        method is defined, if known.

      request_body [string?]

        Whether the request body is allowed in a request message which
        has this method, if known.  One of following values:

          MAY         There can be a request body.
          MUST        There must be a request body, possibly zero-length.
          MUST NOT    There must not be a request body, even if zero-length.

      required [boolean]

        Whether support for the method is required for an HTTP server
        <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#page-22> or an ICAP
        server <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3507#section-4.3.2>.
