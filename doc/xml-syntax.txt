xml-syntax.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The file contains data on the XML syntax.  See |elements.json| for XML
elements and attributes.

* Data structure

The file contains a JSON object, which contains following name/value
pairs:

  charrefs_pubids [object]

    The public identifiers for XHTML named character references DTD
    <http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#parsing-xhtml-documents>.
    Names are the public identifiers and values are boolean true
    values.  XML parsers are expected to support only these public
    identifiers as identifiers of external entities.  These public
    identifiers reference the DTD contained in the file
    |data/xhtml-charrefs.dtd|.

  tokenizer [object]

    A machine-readable description of the XML tokenizer, extracted
    from the XML5 specification.  See |bin/extract-html-tokenizer.pl|
    for details.  Note that the XML5 specification is incomplete (some
    branches of XML tokenizer are not defined).
