<h1><span>Markup declaration open state</span></h1>

<p>If the next two characters are both U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS characters
(-), consume those two characters, create a <span>comment token</span>
whose <i>data</i> is the empty string, and switch to the <span>comment
start state</span>.

<p>Otherwise, if the next seven characters are an <span>ASCII
case-insensitive</span> match for the word "DOCTYPE", then consume
those characters and switch to the <span>DOCTYPE state</span>.

<p>Otherwise, if the next seven characters are a
<span>case-sensitive</span> match for the string "[CDATA[" (the five
uppercase letters "CDATA" with a U+005B LEFT SQUARE BRACKET character
before and after), then consume those characters and switch to
the <span>CDATA section state</span>.

<p>Otherwise, this is a <span>parse error</span>.  Create
a <span>comment token</span> whose data is the empty string. Switch to
the <span>bogus comment state</span> (don't consume anything in the
current state).
